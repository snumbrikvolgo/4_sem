# Snake 
Classic game snake with 2 enemies guided by AI which is written by me.
Game supports 2 interface: tui in terminal and gui in sfml-window

You are violet snake. Blue enemy is "wavy" snake and white is "straight" that's in tty
In gui you are violet too, but your opponents are green who is "wavy" and blue who is "straight"

To quit the game press 'q', to move your snake press "wasd". Your score is on the screen.
